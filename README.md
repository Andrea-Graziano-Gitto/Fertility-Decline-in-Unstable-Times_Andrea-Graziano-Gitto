## Abstract:
This is an amateur study developed as part of a university project, aimed at exploring whether the perception of uncertainty about the future is a widespread sentiment across the population. In pursuing this question, the analysis focused on indicators such as the birth rate, under the assumption that it might reflect why younger generations are increasingly reluctant to take on the responsibility of starting a family, and whether this reluctance is truly driven by uncertainty or if other factors are at play. The study highlights a clear decline in birth rates and identifies several meaningful correlations, ultimately suggesting that the phenomenon is likely the cumulative outcome of economic and medical progress, along with shifting socio-cultural norms.
